### MyLists

MyLists is a website with a nice and clear interface which allows you to list all your TV shows, Anime, Movies, Games and Books (Soon). 
It integrates statistics like watched time, notes, favorites and more. You can follow people, see their lists  
and compare it to yours. You can see a live version here: [https://mylists.info](https://mylists.info).

![MyLists](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Crossoufire/MyLists/master/MyLists/static/img/home2.jpg)

MyLists uses [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and [Material Design for Bootstrap 4](https://mdbootstrap.com/)

### Features

* Create a list for all of your series, anime, movies and games.
* Get informed of your next series, anime and movies to airs.
* Compare your lists with your follows.
* Get statistics about your lists (Time spent, number of episodes watched, prefered genres, etc...)
* More to come!

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9+ (Developed and tested with these versions)
* pip3

### Installation

```
git clone https://www.github.com/Crossoufire/MyLists.git
cd MyLists
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Before starting the program, you *MUST* create a `.env` file respecting the following syntax:

```
FLASK_SECRET_KEY="the-super-secret-key"
FLASK_SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True
FLASK_SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI="sqlite:///site.db"
FLASK_ENV="Production"
FLASK_DEBUG=False
FLASK_TESTING=False
FLASK_MAIL_SERVER="Your mail server"
FLASK_MAIL_PORT=465
FLASK_MAIL_USE_SSL=True
FLASK_MAIL_USERNAME="mail.mail@mail.com"
FLASK_MAIL_PASSWORD="password"
FLASK_THEMOVIEDB_API_KEY="TMDb API key"
```

For example if you want to use Gmail, set `FLASK_MAIL_SERVER = smtp.gmail.com` and `FLASK_MAIL_PORT = 465`. 
If you need more settings, feel free to adapt it as you want.

If you want to first test the project locally, you should put in your `.env` file these values:
```
FLASK_SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=False,  
FLASK_DEBUG=True,
FLASK_TESTING=True,
FLASK_ENV="Development",
```

Then run the command `python3 Run.py` and open the link [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

### Administration

When you run the program for the first time, it will create 3 users: one `user`, one `manager` and one `admin` with 
all the same password `password`:

* `user` - Standard user
* `manager` - Standard user with the right to manage media:
    * Can lock any media, so it won't be updated anymore by cron (to be used for old media with no update needed).
    * When a media is locked, you can edit some of its metadata.
* `admin` - Used for administration tasks (access to all `/admin` pages). Should not be used as a standard user account.
Does not appear in the "Hall of fame" and its statistics are not taken into account.

## Miscellaneous

We started this project to fulfill our needs. The live version [https://mylists.info](https://mylists.info) runs on a 
raspberry pi 4B, thus not meant to be used by a lot of people at the same time, but if you can see the register button 
at the top right of the homepage, feel free to do it. Otherwise, you can run your own version of MyLists ;).

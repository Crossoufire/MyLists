- **Advanced Analytics**: Visualize your habits with detailed statistics, trends, and platform-wide insights.
- **Modern Full-Stack Architecture**: Built with TanStack Start and end-to-end type-safety.
- **Daily Moviedle**: A daily guessing game to test your movie knowledge.
- **Achievements System**: Earn unique badges and track your progress as you consume more media.
- **Secure Authentication**: Robust user management powered by Better-Auth.

### Quick Start

Ensure you have [Bun](https://bun.sh) installed on your machine.

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/crossoufire/MyLists.git
   cd MyLists
   ```

2. **Install deps**
   ```bash
   bun install --frozen-lockfile
   ```

3. **Configure the env file**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and set the three required security values:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   openssl rand -hex 32
   ```

   Run the OpenSSL command twice and use the generated values for `ADMIN_TOKEN_SECRET` and
   `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, then choose an `ADMIN_PASSWORD` of at least 8 chars. All other values have defaults or enable optional features.

4. **Initialize Database**
   Initialize a new SQLite database in the `instance` directory.

   ```bash
   bun run new:db
   ```

5. **Create a new user**
   To create a new user without email verification, OAuth2 setup, and with different roles (user, manager, admin), you can use the CLI:

   ```bash
   bun run cli -- create-user \
     --email admin@example.com \
     --password "change-me-strong-password" \
     --username admin \
     --role admin
   ```

6. **Run the Dev Server**

   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

Commit `bun.lock` alongside `package.json` when updating dependencies. Deployment uses the committed lockfile without resolving new versions.

### Docker Deployment

Docker deployment is documented in [docs/docker-deployment.md](./docs/docker-deployment.md).

The Docker Compose setup builds the app image and starts Redis. It mounts persistent storage for SQLite, images, and Redis data. Provide cron/maintenance scheduling and public
HTTPS from your deployment platform when needed. PostHog is optional and disabled when its public key is empty.

### Redis Setup

Redis caching is optional.

- To run without Redis, set:
  ```bash
  REDIS_ENABLED=false
  ```
- To use Redis, ensure Redis is available and configured:
  ```bash
  REDIS_ENABLED=true
  REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379
  ```

- Redis is used for shared caching, shared rate limiting, and API monitoring rollups.
- Without Redis, the app falls back to in-memory cache/rate limiting.
- The admin API monitoring page will not collect outbound API rollups without Redis.

---

### Optional Feature Availability

Missing optional configuration does not prevent MyLists from starting. Login and registration only show configured authentication methods, while unavailable media providers return
a clear error when used.

- Without admin mail credentials, email registration, password reset, email changes, and mail-dependent maintenance are disabled. Email login still works for verified accounts
  created with the `create-user` CLI.
- GitHub and Google OAuth are enabled independently when their complete client ID/secret pair is present.
- Without TMDB, movie, series, and anime external search/details are unavailable. Without IGDB, game external search/details are unavailable.
- Without `MAL_CLIENT_ID`, manga external search/details are unavailable and anime uses TMDB genres without MyAnimeList enrichment. Register an API client at
  [MyAnimeList API Configuration](https://myanimelist.net/apiconfig).
- Google Books remains available without credentials. `GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY` is optional.
- Without `LLM_API_KEY`, book genre enrichment is skipped with a task warning.

For every optional credential pair, either set both values or leave both blank. A partial pair is treated as a configuration error so typos are caught early.

---

### LLM Integration (Optional)

The LLM is **exclusively used to generate genre data for books** since Google Books does not provide genre metadata. You can choose how this background task runs:

1. **Manually**, by executing it with the CLI
2. **Automatically**, using a scheduled cron job

When `LLM_API_KEY` is absent, direct and scheduled enrichment runs are skipped with a log.

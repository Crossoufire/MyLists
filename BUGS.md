## KNOWN BUGS:

- KNOWN_BUG: `redirect` does not work with function middlewares, need global middleware to manually re-throw error.

## TODO for each page:

- check features parity
- check to remove dead code
- check component mostly DRY
- check theme usage (no random colors)
- check responsive (tablet and mobile)

## DESIGN TO FINISH

- PROFILE: Followers/follows mutation logic.
- PROFILE: Add difference between score and feeling.
